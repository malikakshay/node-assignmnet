Node.js Architecture:

Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven model that allows developers to build scalable network applications.
The key components of Node.js architecture include:

1. Event Loop: Handles asynchronous operations and allows non-blocking I/O operations.
2. V8 JavaScript Engine: Executes JavaScript code and compiles it into machine code.
3. Libuv: Provides the event loop implementation and abstracts I/O operations for multiple platforms.
4. C++ Binding: Allows Node.js to interact with low-level operating system functionalities.

Node.js is well-suited for building real-time applications and APIs due to its non-blocking nature.
